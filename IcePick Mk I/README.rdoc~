TODO:

CAD:
lower bearing brackets DONE

upper motor mount for 200 step motors

upper motor mount for 400 step motors DONE

lower large pulley

upper arms, the 'fingers'

end effector (borrow the one for the kossel mini)

somewhere endstop switches will need to be integrated for homing. later.

SOFTWARE:
make a post processing script for all gcodes, could be done in python, or a cura plugin

OR

make a function in Marlin which will take on inverse kinematic deltas (this is actually the proper way to do it, post proccessing script will do fine for now..)

bed leveling (not going to work, unless we teach marlin inverse kinematics)
