Choosing the size of the main pulley:

The maximum z height is 8 to 10mm at an accuracy of 0.0201mm. This is assuming the use of a 1.8degree stepper and 16x microstepping and a 1:10 ratio between the motor and the upper arms.

8 to 10mm of max z height isn't enough. The solution is to double the upper arm lenght to increase the maximum reach to 16 to 20mm of maximum z height. This will half the accuracy of the machine, but this can be compensated for by increasing the the ratio from 1:10 to 1:20.

Assuming we use a 16 tooth pulley on the motor, we would need the bottom pulley to be 16x20 = 320teeth. The belts used are GT2 and have a spacing of 2mm per tooth. This means that the pulley will have a circumference of 640mm.

diameter = 2x radius.
cirumference = 2pi x radius
640mm = 2pi radius
radius = 101.859mm
