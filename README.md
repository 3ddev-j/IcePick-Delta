IcePick Delta CAD files
=======================
Most of these parts are still being tested and revised, keep in mind they may be improved without prior notice ;)

More details at the <a href="http://hackaday.io/project/1565">Icepick-delta HackaDay page.</a>

It is recomended to use the half pulleys rather than the full round ones, as the half pulleys have a better belt tensioner, use less material, and are less likely to catch on the lower arms.

Firmware
========
Firmware for the Icepick-Delta can be found <a href="https://github.com/Laura3/Marlin/tree/Marlin_v1"> here.</a>
