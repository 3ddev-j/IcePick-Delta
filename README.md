IcePick Delta CAD files
=======================
I should state that this printer is NOT ready for general consumption and is HIGHLY experimental. 

Most of these parts are still being tested and revised, they may be improved without prior notice ;)

Firmware for the Icepick-Delta can be found <a href="https://github.com/Laura3/Marlin/tree/Marlin_v1"> here.</a>
